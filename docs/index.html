<h2>Introduction to the StepManiaX SDK</h2>

The StepManiaX SDK supports C++ development for the <a href=https://stepmaniax.com/>StepManiaX dance platform</a>.
<p>
SDK support: <a href=mailto:sdk@stepmaniax.com>sdk@stepmaniax.com</a>

<h2>Usage</h2>

You can either build the solution and link the resulting SMX.dll to your application,
or import the source project and add it to your Visual Studio solution.  The SDK
interface is <code>SMX.h</code>.
<p>
See <code>SMXSample</code> for a sample application.
<p>
Up to two controllers are supported.  <code>SMX_GetInfo</code> can be used to check which
controllers are connected.  Each <code>pad</code> argument to API calls can be 0 for the
player 1 pad, or 1 for the player 2 pad.

<h2>HID support</h2>

The platform can be used as a regular USB HID input device, which works in any game
that supports input remapping.
<p>
However, applications using this SDK to control the panels directly should ignore the
HID interface, and instead use <code>SMX_GetInputState</code> to retrieve the input state.

<h2>Platform lights</h2>

The platform can have up to nine panels.  Each panel has a grid of 4x4 RGB LEDs, which can
be individually controlled at up to 30 FPS.
<p>
See <code>SMX_SetLights2</code>.

<h2>Update notes</h2>

2019-07-18-01: Added SMX_SetLights2.  This is the same as SMX_SetLights, with an added
parameter to specify the size of the buffer.  This must be used to control the Gen4
pads which have additional LEDs.

<h2>Platform configuration</h2>

The platform configuration can be read and modified using SMX_GetConfig and SMX_SetConfig.
Most of the platform configuration doesn't need to be accessed by applications, since
users can use the SMXConfig application to manage their platform.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <b>enabledSensors</b>
    <p>
    Each platform can have up to nine panels in any configuration, but most devices have
    a smaller number of panels installed.  If an application wants to adapt its UI to the
    user's panel configuration, see enabledSensors to detect which sensors are enabled.
    <p>
    Each panel has four sensors, and if a panel is disabled, all four of its sensors will be
    disabled.  Disabling individual sensors is possible, but removing individual sensors
    reduces the performance of the pad and isn't recommended.
    <p>
    Note that this indicates which panels the player is using for input.  Other panels may
    still have lights support, and the application should always send lights data for all
    possible panels even if it's not being used for input.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Reference</h2>

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_Start(SMXUpdateCallback UpdateCallback, void *pUser);</h3>

Initialize, and start searching for devices.
<p>
UpdateCallback will be called when something happens: connection or disconnection, inputs
changed, configuration updated, test data updated, etc.  It doesn't specify what's changed,
and the user should check all state that it's interested in.
<p>
This is called asynchronously from a helper thread, so the receiver must be thread-safe.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_Stop();</h3>

Shut down and disconnect from all devices.  This will wait for any user callbacks to complete,
and no user callbacks will be called after this returns.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_SetLogCallback(SMXLogCallback callback);</h3>

Set a function to receive diagnostic logs.  By default, logs are written to stdout.
This can be called before SMX_Start, so it affects any logs sent during initialization.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_GetInfo(int pad, SMXInfo *info);</h3>

Get info about a pad.  Use this to detect which pads are currently connected.

<h3 class=ref>uint16_t SMX_GetInputState(int pad);</h3>

Get a mask of the currently pressed panels.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_SetLights(const char lightsData[864]);</h3>

(deprecated)
<p>
Equivalent to SMX_SetLights2(lightsData, 864).  SMX_SetLights2 should be used instead.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_SetLights2(const char *lightsData, int lightDataSize);</h3>
Update the lights.  Both pads are always updated together.  lightsData is a list of 8-bit RGB
colors, one for each LED.
<p>
lightDataSize is the number of bytes in lightsData.  This should be 1350 (2 pads * 9 panels *
25 lights * 3 RGB colors).  For backwards-compatibility, this can also be 864.
<p>
25-LED panels have lights in the following order:
<p>
<pre>
00  01  02  03
  16  17  18
04  05  06  07
  19  20  21
08  09  10  11
  22  23  24
12  13  14  15
</pre>
<p>

16-LED panels have the same layout, ignoring LEDs 16 and up.
<p>
Panels are in the following order:
<p>
<pre>
012 9AB
345 CDE
678 F01
</pre>

Lights will update at up to 30 FPS.  If lights data is sent more quickly, a best effort will be
made to send the most recent lights data available, but the panels won't update more quickly.
<p>
The panels will return to automatic lighting if no lights are received for a while, so applications
controlling lights should send light updates continually, even if the lights aren't changing.
<p>
For backwards compatibility, if lightDataSize is 864, the old 4x4-only order is used,
which simply omits lights 16-24.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_ReenableAutoLights();</h3>

By default, the panels light automatically when stepped on.  If a lights command is sent by
the application, this stops happening to allow the application to fully control lighting.
If no lights update is received for a few seconds, automatic lighting is reenabled by the
panels.
<p>
<code>SMX_ReenableAutoLights</code> can be called to immediately reenable auto-lighting, without waiting
for the timeout period to elapse.  Games don't need to call this, since the panels will return
to auto-lighting mode automatically after a brief period of no updates.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_GetConfig(int pad, SMXConfig *config);</h3>

Get the current controller's configuration.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_SetConfig(int pad, const SMXConfig *config);</h3>

Update the current controller's configuration.  This doesn't block, and the new configuration will
be sent in the background.  SMX_GetConfig will return the new configuration as soon as this call
returns, without waiting for it to actually be sent to the controller.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_FactoryReset(int pad);</h3>

Reset a pad to its original configuration.

<h3 class=ref>void SMX_ForceRecalibration(int pad);</h3>

Request an immediate panel recalibration.  This is normally not necessary, but can be helpful
for diagnostics.

<h3 class=ref>
    void SMX_SetTestMode(int pad, SensorTestMode mode);
    <br>
    bool SMX_GetTestData(int pad, SMXSensorTestModeData *data);
</h3>

Set a panel test mode and request test data.  This is used by the configuration tool.
